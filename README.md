# random-forest

Overview
This project is focused on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 or not. It uses a Random Forest classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to make these predictions. Prior to using the Random Forest classifier, the project preprocesses the data by converting various features into binary format.

Data Preprocessing
Feature Conversion: To make the data suitable for machine learning, the project converts various features into binary ones. This step is crucial to ensure that the Random Forest algorithm can work effectively. For example, categorical features might be transformed into dummy variables, and boolean values may be converted to 0s and 1s.

Model Building
Random Forest Classifier: The heart of this project's predictive power lies in the Random Forest classifier. This ensemble learning algorithm leverages multiple decision trees to make predictions. It excels in handling complex datasets and provides a robust solution for classification tasks.

Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure your dataset is appropriately preprocessed, with features converted to binary format.
Random Forest Training: Train the Random Forest classifier on your preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Inference: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. It will predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 or not.
